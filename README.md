Dinosauria - Classes / Subclasses

--- Classes & SubClasses ---

Introduction:

In Biology, Dinosauria is a taxonomic class, of the phylum Chordata, of
the Kingdom Animalia.  Dinosauria has subclasses, and those have even more
subclasses.  As dinosaurs (parentClass) evolved, new species (subClasses)
inherited characteristics from their ancestors as well as changing, losing
or gaining other characteristics.

In Javascript, classes are objects that share inheritance patterns.  
Characteristics are inherited by subClasses, from their superClasses, and 
they can also be modified at the current class level.

===========================================================================

Overview:

In this lesson, you are provided with the original 1880's Dinosauria written 
into a Javascipt object using the functional instantiation pattern. Start by 
refactoring Dinosauria to use the pseudoclassical instantiation pattern, and 
update the structure tree to match the updated 1960's Dinosauria.  Next, do 
another refactor into the ES6 instantiation pattern..

Instructions:

Using pseudoclassical instantiation, create a phylogeny tree for dinosaurs that mimics the following outline.
