Dinosauria - Classes / Subclasses


-----DINOSAUR PHYLOGENY-----
----- Data Structures  -----
--- Classes & SubClasses ---

Introduction:

In Biology, Dinosauria is a taxonomic class, of the phylum Chordata, of
the Kingdom Animalia.  Dinosauria has subclasses, and those have even more
subclasses.  In Javascript classes are objects that share inheritance
patterns.  Characteristics are inherited by subclasses, from the 
superclasses, and they can also be modified at the current class level.

In this lesson, you will start with a blank object and create a data
structure that mimics the phylogeny tree of Dinosauria.  You may use any
instantiation pattern you would like, and it is recommended that you
complete the exercise in both the pseudoclassical and ES6 styles.

Instructions:

Using pseudoclassical instantiation, create a phylogeny tree for dinosaurs that mimics the following outline.
